# Project Introduction: "Hustle and Hassle"
Welcome to "Hustle and Hassle," a digital narrative that endeavors to shed light on the vibrant hustle culture thriving at NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD). This project serves as an exploration of the dynamic ethos that permeates our NYUAD community. 

**Project Name and Description**: 
At the heart of "Hustle and Hassle" lies the notion that our time at NYUAD is a whirlwind journey, marked by the relentless passage of time, especially during weekends and semester breaks. To encapsulate this essence, our project logo takes the form of a clock, serving as a poignant reminder of time's ceaseless march. I deliberately chose not to pursue a traditional "professional" website design, in line with NYU Abu Dhabi's culture of pushing boundaries and fostering individuality. Instead, I embraced a scrapbook-style design adorned with sticky notes, symbolizing the numerous simultaneous happenings at our institution, which can sometimes be a bit challenging to navigate.

- **Concept Page**: Dive into the perspectives of NYUAD students as they offer insights into the hustle culture through a collection of interviews. For the full interview experience, refer to the recommended videos on the video page.
- **Culture Page**: Embark on a witty and satirical journey through the various facets of NYUAD's culture, a narrative that will particularly resonate with fellow NYUAD students who understand the subtleties of our unique environment.
- **Video Page**: Experience the rapid pace of life at NYUAD through our time-lapse video of the campus, an artistic depiction of the bustling activity that defines our community. Additionally, don't miss the insightful interviews on the hustle culture, available among the recommended videos.
- **Cast Page**: Meet the talented crew behind the creation of our main video.

**Process**:
I started this journey with meticulous planning, including wireframing and critical design choices concerning colors and fonts. I actively sought feedback from friends and peers to refine our vision.
The process of bringing my vision to life unfolded with relative ease once we honed our skills. Crafting the humorous and engaging content for the culture page was particularly fun. I struggled with positioning a lot, because it seems very easy to do until you get to it. Even if the images are unaligned with a few pixels, it made a lot of difference aesthetically. So, I used a similar and consistent layout for the culture and concept page (to make my life slightly easier). 

**Reflection and Evaluation**:
"Hustle and Hassle" successfully meets most of our goals and expectations, delivering an engaging narrative of NYUAD's hustle culture. I initially envisioned incorporating a timer to emphasize the relentless passage of time, but the complexity of adding this meant I had to abandon the idea. Similarly, my initial concept of a more scattered sticky note layout proved visually awkward, prompting us to pivot toward a more structured design.

In summary, "Hustle and Hassle" captures the essence of NYUAD's vibrant hustle culture through a visually engaging and thought-provoking digital narrative. I invite you to explore and revel in the unique experience that is life at NYU Abu Dhabi.
